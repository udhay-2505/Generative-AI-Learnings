# 🤖 My Generative AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Generative AI Learnings Repository** a collection of notebooks, experiments, and projects I’ve built while exploring the exciting world of **Generative Artificial Intelligence**.

This repo serves as both a personal knowledge base and a practical showcase of my progress in **LLMs, diffusion models, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** systems.
